# Book Companion
This repository is a companion repository for the upcoming book about Hyperledger Fabric chaincode development. It contains two main folders: `samples` and `cc-tools-demo`. 

## Samples

The `samples` folder contains a test network directory taken directly from the `hyperledger/fabric-samples` repository used in Chapter 6 of the book. This repository aims to take only the essential parts of the original repository without altering functionality while using a fixed version that is known to work with the book.

The `hyperledger/fabric-samples` repository goes through frequent updates using always the latest version of Fabric which may cause issues with the book. This repository will be updated to fix issues in the version used in the book.

## CC-Tools Demo

The `cc-tools-demo` folder contains the full Hyperledger Labs CC-Tools-Demo project taken from `hyperledger-labs/cc-tools-demo` and used from Chapter 7 and onward of the book. This repository aims to take a fixed version that is known to work with the book.
